        <h2>Tax Benefits on Education Loans</h2>
        <p>The interest you pay on your student loan can be deducted under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act of 1961. This advantage is only available to individual borrowers and is only offered for the purpose of higher education. The deduction is available to all fields of study, both domestically and internationally. It includes both vocational and academic courses.</p>
        <p>It's important to remember that the tax deduction only applies to the interest portion of the EMI, not the principle. There is, however, no limit to how many times you can claim this benefit. You'll need a certificate from your bank or financial institution that separates the principal and interest components of your EMIs to qualify for this benefit.</p>
        <p>This benefit is accessible for eight years from the day you start repaying your loan or until the interest component is paid off, whichever comes first.</p>

        <h2>How to Calculate Education Loan EMI</h2>
        <p>An education loan EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount a student has to pay every month to repay their education loan. The EMI includes both the principal loan amount and the interest charged by the bank or lending institution.</p>
        <p>The following formula illustrates how educational loan EMI is calculated:</p>
        <p>EMI = [P * R * (1 + R)^n] / [(1 + R)^n - 1]</p>
        <p>Where,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P = Principal amount</li>
            <li>R = Rate of interest</li>
            <li>n = Tenure in months</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Consider Mr. Kapoor, who borrows an educational loan of Rs. 10 lakhs at an average interest rate of 12% for a two-year period. The calculated EMI would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>P = Rs. 10 lakhs</li>
                <li>R = 12/100/12 (converted to months)</li>
                <li>n = 2 years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The EMI would be Rs. 46,073</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Education Loan Repayment Process</h2>
        <p>The loan repayment period normally starts 12 months after completion of the course or 6 months after employment, whichever comes first. Applicants are given varied moratorium periods by different lenders when it comes to repaying their loans. You will be required to repay your loan using EMIs.</p>

        <h2>Different Modes of Repayment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Banking - Pay online through the lender's website or mobile app</li>
            <li>Cheque - Drop a cheque at any of the branches</li>
            <li>Direct debit - Set up recurring payments for your EMI to be directly debited from your bank account on the payment due date</li>
            <li>Demand Draft - Pay through a DD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preferred method of repayment varies between lenders. Therefore, it is advisable to check with your lender when taking the loan.</p>

        <h2>Moratorium Period</h2>
        <p>In the case of education loans, the beneficiaries will be able to start paying off the loan after the completion of the educational course or after successful employment.</p>

        <h2>Part-Payment of Education Loans</h2>
        <p>The beneficiaries of education loans will be allowed to make part payments towards their loans. As an applicant, you can pay back a lump sum amount to make part repayment of the loan.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Payment of Education Loans</h2>
        <p>If an applicant is able to manage the funds for the pre-payment of the loan amount, he or she will be able to do the same. However, it should be kept in mind that this might incur a processing fee.</p>
