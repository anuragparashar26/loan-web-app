        <h1>Credit Score Checker</h1>
        <p>the credit score checker allows you to calculate your credit score report and cibil score. it is a three-digit numeric expression that represents your creditworthiness.</p>
        <p>if you are planning to request a credit card, then it is recommended to have your cibil score be at least 750. reviewing the history of credit of the applicant is an essential part of the screening process.</p>

        <h2>what is a credit score and how is it calculated?</h2>
        <p>a credit score is a statistical representation of one’s creditworthiness. it helps in evaluating your ability to pay back the amount you have borrowed. a person’s credit score usually ranges from 300-900, and the one with the highest score is considered to be a trustworthy applicant. always try to reach the highest in range as it becomes very beneficial at the time of applying for a loan or a credit card. whereas, if you have a low score or you fall in lower range this displays you are an irresponsible loan applicant and have not made timely payments of your loans/dues.</p>

        <h3>CIBIL score range</h3>

                <td>550 – 649</td>

                <td>this CIBIL score shows that you have good credit behaviour. you have a high chance of getting a credit card or loan approval. however, you may still not get the best rate of interest while applying for a loan.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>750 – 900</td>
                <td>CIBIL score above 750 is considered excellent and shows that you have consistently paid your dues on time and have an impressive payment history. since you are at the lowest risk of turning into a defaulter, lenders will give you loans easily and at lower interest rates.</td>

        <ul>
            <li>personal information</li>
            <li>credit history length</li>
            <li>new credit</li>

            <li>payment history</li>
            <li>credit mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>why is it important to maintain a good credit score?</h2>
        <p>listed down some of the important reasons due to which you must maintain a good credit score:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>improves your eligibility for loans: a good credit score improves your eligibility to get a loan faster. a good credit score means that you pay the bills or outstanding amount timely that leaves a good impression of yours on the banks or other financial institutions where you have applied for a loan.</li>
            <li>quicker loan approvals: applicants with a good credit score and long credit history are offered pre-approved loans. moreover, the loan that you have applied for gets approved quickly and processing time is zero.</li>
            <li>lower interest rate: with a good credit score, you can enjoy the benefit of a lower rate of interest on the loan amount that you have applied for.</li>
            <li>credit cards with attractive benefits- you are offered credit cards with attractive benefits and rewards if you have a healthy credit score.</li>
            <li>higher credit card limits: a good credit score not only gets you the best of credit cards with attractive benefits or lower rate of interest on the loan you have applied for but also you are eligible for getting a higher loan amount. a good credit score means that you are capable of handling the credit in the best possible manner, therefore, banks or financial institutions will consider offering you a credit card with a higher limit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>what are the factors that are considered for calculating credit score?</h2>
        <p>a credit score is calculated by the credit information departments considering various factors that are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>credit score history: credit history depicts the capability of the loan applicant whether he/she is responsible for paying the debts or not. it has the details of the number of accounts that you hold, credit usage details and information regarding delayed or failed payments.</li>
            <li>credit score inquiries: credit inquiries include the information like the type of loan who have inquired about, the amount of loan you have applied for and whether you are an individual applicant or a joint applicant.</li>
            <li>repayment record: repayment record consists of the details regarding your timeliness of repayment and failed payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>how is the credit score calculated?</h2>
        <p>a credit score is calculated differently by the various credit information bureaus. general factors on the basis of which your credit score is calculated are mentioned below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>payment history - 35% of your credit score is calculated on the basis of your payment history. your payment history shows how timely you’ve made the payments, how many times you've missed on the payments or how many days past the due date you’ve paid your bills. so you can score high if you have a higher proportion of on-time payments. make sure you never miss out on payments as this would leave a negative impact on your score.</li>
            <li>how much you owe - about 30% of your credit score depends upon how much you owe on loans and credit cards. if you have a high balance and have reached the limit of your credit card then this would lead to a drop in your credit score. while small balances and timely payments would help in increasing the score.</li>
            <li>credit history length - the length of your credit history is accountable for 15% of your credit score. if your history of on-time payments is long then definitely you would have a higher credit score. having said that, at some point, you must apply for a credit card or loan rather than avoiding it so that you also have a credit history for banks’ review.</li>
            <li>how many products you have - the products (types of loans) that you have is responsible for the 10% of your credit score. having a mix of various products like installment loans, home loans, and credit cards help in increasing your credit score.</li>
            <li>credit activity - remaining 10% depends on your recent credit activities. credit activity includes all the information regarding opening or applying for various accounts, repayment history, types of loans you have applied for and credit limit usage.</li>
        </ul>
